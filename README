This server only supports the HTTP method GET. 

It'll probably only build with Visual Studio. You may need to remove the "#include <WinSock2.h>" from your Windows.h file (It causes issues sometimes).

It will serve files relative to where it's run from. For example if it's run from C:\ and you then open http://localhost/Example.html, the file sent will be C:\Example.html.
